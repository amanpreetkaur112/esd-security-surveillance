SOLUTION
Intruder Detection
Our system can trace any intruder attempting to tamper with or steal parts from the vehicle. It captures detailed footage and provides real-time alerts to the owner, enhancing the chances of apprehending the culprit and preventing further damage.
Alert System
Highly sensitive sensors are strategically placed within and around the vehicle to detect any unauthorized access or suspicious activity. Upon triggering, these sensors promptly send alert signals directly to the owner's smartphone, allowing for immediate awareness and action.
Cloud Storage
All captured video files and alert logs are securely stored in a dedicated cloud storage system. This ensures that even if the camera itself is damaged or stolen, the crucial evidence remains accessible to the owner and law enforcement, facilitating vehicle recovery and investigation efforts.
